A sample size of 2 per group yields a power of 0.09
A sample size of 3 per group yields a power of 0.23
A sample size of 4 per group yields a power of 0.4
A sample size of 5 per group yields a power of 0.52
A sample size of 6 per group yields a power of 0.65
A sample size of 7 per group yields a power of 0.61
A sample size of 8 per group yields a power of 0.76
Using alpha = 0.05 with an expected effect size of 0.8, a sample size of 9 per group is necessary to achieve a power of 0.85
